# Badges-plugin

**This plugin has stopped working, I'm working on a fix but if anyone has a fix for it join my discord!**

``Discord``: https://discord.gg/tYM54nEmYc

A better discord plugin that allows the user to have any badge they want (client side)

To start you download better discord @ https://betterdiscord.app

Then download the zip and add the badges.plugin.js to your plugins folder and ensure its enabled and you are good to go!

Currently you will have every badge avalible on discord including staff badges and all the hypesquad badges, If you would like to change this head to the plugin and click the pencil button and under ``let flags = {`` remove the line of the badge you dont want!

Remember this is client side!!
